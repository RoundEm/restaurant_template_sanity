# Rob's Burgers (Restaurant Website Template)
This is a template website I'm building for restaurants and other businesses that sell foodstuffs (because how often have you seen great restaurants with terrible, archaic, unresponsive, unfriendly websites, or where their only online presence is actual pictures taken of their menu?!) The site theme is drawn from a fictional mustachio'd burger man and his family burger establishment.

## Tools
- Next.js (React)
- Styled Components
- Sanity.io CMS

## TODOs
- allow order save functionality and add something to UI confirming order was added
- add validation for pending order items when user goes to new page from OrderItemModal
// (i.e. "are you sure you don't want to save this item to your order")
- Add some form of local storage for incomplete orders and favorite orders
- make modals more ally friendly (e.g. focus mgmt, allow checkboxes to be checked with Return/Enter) and audit for overall a11y
- setup env variables
- add background art/images
- style order quantity increment/decrement
- allow Special Requests to be edited from order summary page
- Change menu IDs to menu slugs in url? 
- add fields in Sanity to allow admin sorting of menu items on order page
- add some animation (maybe to menu names, order details, order "cart")
- setup Admin dashboard where you can view past orders and metrics
