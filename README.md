# Rob's Burgers (Restaurant Website Template)
This is a template website I'm building for restaurants and other businesses that sell foodstuffs (because how often have you seen great restaurants with terrible, archaic, unresponsive, unfriendly websites, or where their only online presence is actual pictures taken of their menu?!) The site theme is drawn from a fictional mustachio'd burger man and his family burger establishment.

## Tools
- Next.js (React)
- Sanity.io CMS
- Styled Components

## TODOs
- style order quantity increment/decrement
- setup env variables
- add "Burger of the Day" feature that randomly chooses and displays a non-basic burger
- allow Special Requests to be edited from order summary page
- add order/check out functionality (for user and client admin)
- add images and/or art
- create modal for order details
- Add some form of local storage for incomplete orders and favorite orders
- Change menu IDs to menu slugs in url? 
- add fields in Sanity to allow admin sorting of menu items on order page
- add some animation (maybe to menu names, order details, order "cart")
