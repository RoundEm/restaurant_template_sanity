# Rob's Burgers (Restaurant Website Template)
This is a template website I'm building for restaurants and other businesses that sell foodstuffs (because how often have you seen great restaurants with terrible, archaic, unresponsive, unfriendly websites, or where their only online presence is actual pictures taken of their menu?!) The site theme is drawn from a fictional mustachio'd burger man and his family burger establishment.

## Tools
- Next.js (React)
- Sanity.io CMS
- Styled Components

## TODOs
- [ ] add order/check out functionality (for user and client admin)
- [ ] add images and/or art
- [ ] create modal for order details
- [ ] Add some form of local storage for incomplete orders and favorite orders
- [ ] Change menuIDs to menu slugs? Also change `getInitialProps` to newer options
- [ ] add fields in Sanity to allow admin sorting of menu items on order page
